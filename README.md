## Overview

The aim of this project is to create and provide a comprehensive geology and earth sciences dictionary that provides a resource that is accessible and visually appealing to all experience levels from geology experts, to experienced amateurs, through to complete beginners. Interested users can register with the site, allowing them to add new terrms and definitions and edit their own entries. A search facility allows users to search existing terms and definitions.
